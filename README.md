Frontend Wizardry: Armed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I conjure up spellbinding user interfaces that are as responsive as a cat on a hot tin roof. React and Vue.js are my trusty sidekicks, helping me turn ideas into pixel-perfect realities.
Backend Sorcery: On the flip side, I wield the power of Python and Java to create backend solutions that are as solid as my morning coffee. With Django and Spring Boot in my toolkit, I craft APIs that can handle anything from a simple request to a full-blown data feast!

Frontend: JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue), HTML5, CSS3
Backend: Python (Django, Flask), Java (Spring, Hibernate), Node.js
Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
